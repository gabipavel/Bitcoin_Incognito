***Step 2***

* Fill in the form. 
* For `Alias` type something like "MN01" **don't use spaces**
* The `Address` is the IP and port (7339) of your server (this will be in the Bitvise terminal that you still have open).
* The `Genkey` is your masternode Gen key (This is also in the Bitvise terminal that you have open).
* The `TxHash` is the transaction ID/long key that you copied to the text file.
* The `Output Index` is the 0 or 1 that you copied to your text file.
![Example-create](https://i.imgur.com/9b1I3bk.png)

Click "File Save"
***

***Step 3***
* Close out of the wallet and reopen Wallet
* Open debug console and enter `startmasternode all false` if you don't have any other masternodes running, otherwise use `startmasternode alias false 'Alias'`
* 'Alias' should be replaced with the alias you gave your new masternode, like MN01 in our example


***

***step 4***
* Check the status of your masternode within the VPS by using the command below:

`xbi-cli getmasternodestatus`

`xbi-cli getinfo`

*You should see ***status 4***

If you do, congratulations! You have now setup a masternode. If you do not, please contact support and they will assist you.

## FAQ

If you don't see ***status 4***

Check if your wallet is syncing with `xbi-cli getinfo`. 
If your wallet is stuck, use the commands `systemctl stop XBI.service` and `xbid -reindex -daemon` to reindex.
Wait a few minutes and check the status again with `xbi-cli getinfo`
If your wallet is on the correct block, use `xbi-cli stop` and `systemctl start XBI.service` to restart the service.
Wait until `xbi-cli mnsync status` returns true on everything but the "isFailed"
Retry starting the masternode from you local wallet.
